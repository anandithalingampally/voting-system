MINI VOTING PROJECT

 
Feature list: Voting, vote count, exit.

As soon as the application is opened, the user will be able to see all the three features.

Methods used in the project to implement feature and application logic:

Feature logic:  1) Voting feature
          
                  If the voting feature is chosen, the CANDIDATE LIST appears and you have to choose one candidate from the list.
                  After choosing the candidate, you are directed back to the menu.


                2) Vote count feature
 
                 After the voting is completed, if vote count feature is chosen, The CANDIDATE with highest number of votes is displayed.
                 And after the count is shown, you are directed back to the menu.

                3) Exit feature
                  
                  After viewing the vote count, if the exit feature is chosen, you will be exited from the application.
